# Breast-cancer-project


## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict breast cancer based on various medical features. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about breast cancer patients, including tumor characteristics and other relevant medical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset, which contains features computed from a digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. The dataset includes 569 instances and 30 features.

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:

-Radius

-Texture

-Perimeter

-Area

-Smoothness

-Compactness

-Concavity

-Concave points

-Symmetry

-Fractal dimension

## Model

The machine learning model used in this project is a Random Forest classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier and Logistic Regression. The model is trained on the dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

-numpy

-pandas

-scikit-learn

-matplotlib


## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 98% on the test dataset. The confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics are provided in the results section of the project.
