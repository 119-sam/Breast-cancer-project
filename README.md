# Breast-cancer-project


## Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict breast cancer based on various medical features. The model is trained on a dataset containing information about breast cancer patients, including tumor characteristics and other relevant medical data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-Learn, which contains numerical features computed from fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. It includes 569 instances with 30 numerical features, used to classify tumors as malignant or benign based on various characteristics.

## Features
The dataset includes the following features:

-Radius

-Texture

-Perimeter

-Area

-Smoothness

-Compactness

-Concavity

-Concave points

-Symmetry

-Fractal dimension

## Model

The machine learning model used in this project is a Random Forest classifier, XGBoost Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbors Classifier and Logistic Regression. The model is trained on the dataset to predict whether a tumor is malignant or benign.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

-numpy

-pandas

-scikit-learn

-matplotlib


## Results
The model achieves an accuracy of 98% on the test dataset. The confusion matrix and other evaluation metrics are provided in the results section of the project.
